Describing the process of how I publish package/modules/libraries to different
ecosystems.

[Discuss](https://ultirequiem.com/discord)

## General

Some things I want to have in common with all my packages.

### Install Instructions

Even if the user (_probably_) already knows, I want them to be able to
copy-paste the command.

If there isn't a install step, eg. Deno, just jump to the Example Usage section.

While if they are multiple ways, eg. Node.js, give support just for the more
popular one.

> Although I was used to give example of the 3 most popular ones, most packages

If is a CLI tool, always give binary options when possible.

Distribute them by Releases, [Shell Script](https://shellscript.sh) and
[PowerShell Script](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview).

### Support

Can have extra comments is needed.
