Describing the process of how I publish package/modules/libraries to different
ecosystems.

[Discuss](https://ultirequiem.com/discord)

## General

Some things I want to have in common with all my packages.

### Install Instructions

Even if the user (_probably_) already knows, I want them to be able to
copy-paste the command.

- If there isn't a install step, eg. Deno, just jump to the Example Usage
  section.

- While if they are multiple ways, eg. Node.js, give support just for the more
  popular one.

If is a CLI tool, always give binary options when possible.

Distribute it by 👇

- Releases

- [Shell Script](https://shellscript.sh)

- [PowerShell Script](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview)

### Support

Can have extra comments is needed.

### Alternatives

listed here.
