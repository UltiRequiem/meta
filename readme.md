Describing the process of how I publish package/modules/libraries to different
ecosystems.

[Discuss](https://ultirequiem.com/discord)

## General

Some things I want to have in common with all my packages.

### Install Instructions

Even if the user _probably_ already knows, I want them to be able to copy-paste
the command.

- If there isn't a install step, eg. Deno, jump to the Example Usage section.

- While if they are multiple ways just show the most popular one.

If is a CLI tool, always give binary options when possible.

Distribute it by 👇

- Releases

- [Shell Script](https://shellscript.sh)

- [PowerShell Script](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview)

> Example 👉 [ultirequiem/chigo](https://github.com/UltiRequiem/chigo)

### Example Usage

If is a library, a code snippet. While if is a CLI Tool a video/screenshot and
usage example is cool.

> Example 👉 [ultirequiem/ruquotes](https://github.com/UltiRequiem/ruquotes)
